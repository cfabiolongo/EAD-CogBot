It is a great world
I am a scholar
She is my best friend
The sky is grey
We went to the garden
They are sad
It is a wonderful day
the dog is in the yard
He is a talented writer
This book is boring
The movie was terrific
My parents are singers
The uncles are in house
The milk is too cold
It is time to go to lunch
These shoes are uncomfortable
She is an excellent dancer
The exam is difficult
We are at the park
The baby is playing
